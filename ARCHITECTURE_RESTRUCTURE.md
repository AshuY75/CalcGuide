# CalcGuide Architecture Restructure & SEO Strategy (2026)

## 1. Calculator Categorization Audit

We have reorganized the 19 existing calculators into **5 High-Impact Categories** based on user intent and topical relevance.

### Category 1: Loans & Credit (Money You Borrow)
**Purpose:** Tools for borrowers to estimate repayment and eligibility.
**SEO Logic:** Target high-volume keywords like "Home Loan EMI", "Personal Loan eligibility", and specialized "Village Interest" queries.
*   **EMI Calculator** (`/emi`)
*   **Loan Eligibility** (`/loan-eligibility`)
*   **Village Interest (Sood)** (`/village-interest`)
*   **Simple Interest** (`/si`)

### Category 2: Investment & Savings (Money You Grow)
**Purpose:** Wealth creation tools for investors and savers.
**SEO Logic:** Dominate keywords like "SIP Returns", "FD Interest Rates", and "Crorepati Calculator".
*   **SIP Calculator** (`/sip`)
*   **Target SIP (1 Cr Goal)** (`/sip-1cr`)
*   **FD Calculator** (`/fd`)
*   **RD Calculator** (`/rd`)
*   **Compound Interest** (`/ci`)

### Category 3: Gold & Wealth (Jewellery & Assets)
**Purpose:** Buying/Selling gold and precious metals.
**SEO Logic:** Capture transaction-intent queries for "Gold Price Today", "Old Gold Exchange Value".
*   **Gold Jewellery Price** (`/gold-jewellery`)
*   **Old Gold Exchange** (`/old-gold`)

### Category 4: Construction & Land (Real Estate)
**Purpose:** Planning home construction and land measurement.
**SEO Logic:** Target niche but high-intent keywords like "House Construction Cost", "Bigha to SqFt".
*   **Construction Cost** (`/construction-cost`)
*   **Brick Calculator** (`/brick`)
*   **Land Area Converter** (`/land-area`)

### Category 5: General Utility (Daily Life Tools)
**Purpose:** Essential day-to-day calculations.
**SEO Logic:** High traffic volume for "Age Calculator" and generalized math queries.
*   **Age Calculator** (`/age`)
*   **Date Difference** (`/date-diff`)
*   **Exam Eligibility** (`/exam`)
*   **Percentage Calculator** (`/percentage`)

## 2. Navigation & URL Structure

### Header Drodown Design
The header will feature a "Calculators" mega-menu or split dropdowns for the top 3 categories, plus a "More" dropdown.

**Primary Nav Items:**
1.  **Loans** (Dropdown)
2.  **Investments** (Dropdown)
3.  **Gold & Construction** (Dropdown)
4.  **Utility** (Dropdown)

### Recommended Future URL Structure
*Currently, we use root paths (e.g., `/emi`). For Phase 3 scalability, we should migrate to:*
*   `calcguide.com/loans/emi-calculator`
*   `calcguide.com/investments/sip-calculator`
*   `calcguide.com/gold/jewellery-price`

*Note: For now, we will maintain current root paths to preserve existing backlinks and prevent route breakage.*

## 3. SEO & Internal Linking Strategy

### Breadcrumb Hierarchy
Home > Investments > SIP Calculator

### Inter-Category Linking Rules
1.  **Loan -> Investment:** "Can you afford this Loan? Check how much you can save with SIP instead."
2.  **Gold -> Loan:** "Need cash? Check Gold Loan value vs Personal Loan EMI."
3.  **Construction -> Loan:** "Building a house? Check Home Loan Eligibility."

## 4. Branding Strategy
**Tagline:** "Sahi Hisab, Sahi Faisla"
**Placement:** Typewriter animation in the Header (Desktop: Next to Logo, Mobile: Sub-header).
