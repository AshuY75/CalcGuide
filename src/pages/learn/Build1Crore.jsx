                    <h2>Why ₹1 Crore? (The Anchor Milestone)</h2>
                    <p>
                        In India, the number "One Crore" carries more than just monetary value; it represents financial freedom and the transition from a 'saver' to an 'investor'. However, money is not static. Due to inflation (averaging 6-7% in India), ₹1 Crore today will buy significantly more than ₹1 Crore will in 20 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite this, reaching your first crore is critical because it represents the <strong>Critical Mass</strong> of your portfolio. Once you have ₹1 Crore invested, a 12% market return generates ₹12 Lakhs a year—often more than a senior professional's annual savings.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The 15-15-15 Rule: The Golden Standard</h2>
                    <p>
                        The most famous mathematical shortcut for Indian investors is the 15-15-15 rule. It simplifies the complexity of compounding into three easy-to-remember numbers:

                    <h2>Realistic Timelines based on Returns</h2>
                    <p>
                        While 15% is achievable through aggressive Mid-cap or Small-cap funds, many prefer a more conservative Large-cap Index approach (12%). Here is the roadmap for different survival budgets:

                    <h2>The "Step-Up" Strategy (The Secret Accelerator)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most people wait for their salary to increase before increasing their SIP. This is a mistake. By automating a <strong>10% Annual Step-Up</strong>, you can reach your goal much faster without feeling the pinch on your current lifestyle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Example:</strong> A ₹10,000 SIP takes 19 years to hit ₹1 Crore at 12%. But if you increase your SIP amount by just 10% every year, you hit the target in <strong>14 years</strong>. You save 5 years of your life!
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Three Psychological Stages</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Stage 1: The Grind (0 - ₹25 Lakhs)</strong><br />
                            This is where 90% of investors quit. In the first 5 years, your portfolio might grow by ₹5 Lakhs but you've invested ₹6 Lakhs. It feels like "market isn't working." At this stage, your <strong>Savings Rate</strong> is the machine, not the market.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Stage 2: The Momentum (₹25 - ₹75 Lakhs)</strong><br />
                            This is the "Crossing the Chasm" phase. Suddenly, a 10% market jump adds ₹5 Lakhs to your net worth—more than your entire annual contribution. The excitement builds here.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Stage 3: The Explosion (₹75 Lakhs - ₹1 Crore)</strong><br />
                            The last 25 Lakhs usually happens in roughly 1/4th the time it took to reach the first 25 Lakhs. This is pure compounding at work.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                        <p className="mb-0">Charlie Munger once famously said, "The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it." In India, the first ₹10 Lakhs is that barrier. Once you cross it, you are no longer just saving; you are wealthy in training.</p>

                    <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Withdrawing for Lifestyle:</strong> Upgrading your car just when your portfolio hits ₹30 Lakhs resets your compounding clock back by 3-4 years.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chasing Last Year's Winner:</strong> Switching funds every year based on "Top Rated" tags destroys returns due to exit loads and missing the recovery days.</li>
                        <li><strong>Underestimating Tax:</strong> Always account for the 12.5% LTCG tax (Exemption up to ₹1.25L) on mutual fund profits.</li>
                    </ul>
